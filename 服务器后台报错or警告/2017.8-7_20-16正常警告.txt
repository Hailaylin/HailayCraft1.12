[19:37:12 WARN]: Mon Aug 07 19:37:12 CST 2017 WARN: 
Establishing SSL connection without server's identity verification is not recommended. According to MySQL 5.5.45+, 5.6.26+ and 5.7.6+ requirements SSL connection must be established by default if explicit option isn't set. For compliance with existing applications not using SSL the verifyServerCertificate property is set to 'false'. You need either to explicitly disable SSL by setting useSSL=false, or set useSSL=true and provide truststore for server certificate verification.

[19:37:06 WARN]: **** SERVER IS RUNNING IN OFFLINE/INSECURE MODE!
[19:37:06 WARN]: The server will make no attempt to authenticate usernames. Beware.
[19:37:06 WARN]: While this makes the game possible to play without internet access, it also opens up the ability for hackers to connect with any username they choose.
[19:37:06 WARN]: To change this, set "online-mode" to "true" in the server.properties file.

前面的一个是使用MySQL没有使用SSL不安全，不用管；
后一个则是关闭了正版验证。
所以，也就是没有报错，是正常的警告而已。
