# DeluxeMenus 1.9.2 main configuration file
# 
# check_updates: <true/false>
#   Should DeluxeMenus check if there are any updates available on Spigot and inform ops there is an update available.
# 
# ==============================================================
# 
# PER ITEM PERMISSION AND PRIORITY INFO:
# 
# Per item permissions and priorities are optional.
# High priority = 1, Lowest priority = 2147483647.
# This allows you to show different items for a specific menu slot depending on the highest priority
# item permission a player has. This makes your menus very dynamic :)
# 
# You CAN NOT specify a permission without a priority!
# You CAN specify a priority without a permission.
# You should always create a low priority item without a permission which will act as the no permission
# item if a player does not have permission for any of the items that require permission, otherwise
# no item will be set in the slot if a player does not have permission for any of the permission items.
# 
# ==============================================================
# 
# GUI menu configuration:
# 
# You can create as many GUI menus you like.
# Every menu name must be unique. There can not be duplicate menu names!
# Players must have permission for a GUI menu to open one!
# Ops should automatically have permission for any GUI menu.
# 
# Permission to open a GUI menu is: deluxemenus.guimenu.<menuName>
# 
# You specify the command which opens the GUI menu. Make sure this command
# does not conflict with any existing commands on your server!
# A GUI menu without an open command specified will not be loaded!
# 
# GUI menus configuration layout:
# 
# gui_menus:
#   <menuName>:
#     menu_title: '<title of menu goes here>'
#     command: <command to open this menu goes here>
#     inventory_type: '<add this option if you want to create a menu of a different InventoryType aside from chest>'
#     open_requirement:
#       expression: 'BukkitPlayer.hasPermission("some.permission");'
#       deny_commands:

#     size: <size of this menu, increments of 9, max size is 54>
#     update_interval: <time in seconds this gui should update for a player if an item is set to uodate placeholders>

#         display_name: <display name to show for this item>
#         lore:
#         - 'placeholders can be used in the name and lore'
#         - '%<any placeholder from Papi>% shows the viewer values'
#         enchantments: valid enchantment names can be found here: https://hub.spigotmc.org/javadocs/spigot/org/bukkit/enchantments/Enchantment.html
#         - '<ENCHANTMENT>;<LEVEL>'
#         - 'SILK_TOUCH;1'
#         left_click_commands:
#         - '[close]'
#         right_click_commands:
#         - '[player] spawn'
# 
# 
# You can specify if a GUI menu should be loaded from another file:
# 
# gui_menus:
#   <menuName>:
#     file: 'menuName.yml'
# 
# This allows you to keep your config clean and not have tons of GUI menus cluttering it.
# The file format the GUI menu is loaded from must end in .yml
# GUI menus loaded from other configuration files must follow a specific format as well...
# To get started loading GUI menus from different files, simply create a GUI menu in this config and specify the file it will load from.
# After that is done, use /dm reload and DeluxeMenus will create a folder and file specific to the GUI menu you specified.
# If the file specified is created by DeluxeMenus (because it did not exist), a default GUI menu layout will be saved to that file.
# From here you can edit it to your liking and use /dm reload to update your GUI menu! 
# 
# This loading from external config files is only available for gui menus and will not work for click menus yet....
# 
# banner_meta must be listed with a specific format:
# banner_meta:
# - <DyeColor>;<PatternType>
# 
# Valid DyeColor names can be found here: https://hub.spigotmc.org/javadocs/bukkit/org/bukkit/DyeColor.html
# Valid PatternTypes can be found here: https://hub.spigotmc.org/javadocs/bukkit/org/bukkit/block/banner/PatternType.html
# ==============================================================
# 
# Click requirement information
# 
# You can add 'click requirements' to left and right click commands'
# These are defined per item and must follow a specific format:
# 
#   'item_one':
#     material: DIAMOND
#     slot: 3
#     left_click_commands:
#     - '[close]'
#     - '[message] You were charged 100 dollars for clicking that item!'
#     - '[console] eco take %player% 100'
#     left_click_requirement:
#       expression: '%vaulteco_balance% > 100'
#       deny_commands:
#       - '[close]'
#       - '[message] &cYou dont have 100 dollars to click that item'
#     right_click_commands:
#     - '[close]'
#     - '[message] You had permission to click that item!'
#     right_click_requirement:
#       expression: 'BukkitPlayer.hasPermission("some.permission.toclick")'
#       deny_commands:
#       - '[close]'
#       - '[message] &cYou dont have permission to click that item'
# 
# Every left/right_click_requirement MUST have an expression specified that would return a boolean (true/false)
# These expressions must also follow JavaScript format as they are all javascript based!
# 
# deny_commands: are optional and will be executed if the expression returns false.
# You may use placeholders in your Javascript expressions to evaluate if the player meets the requirement or not.
# You may also use a few keywords which give you access to the Player class and Bukkit.Server class if you understand the Bukkit API
# 
# BukkitPlayer - references the Player object your expression is evaluating.
# BukkitServer - references Bukkit.getServer() in the Bukkit API.
# 
# The choice to use this system to evaluate if a player meets requirements to click an item was an easy choice.
# This way I do not have to hook into every plugin to check if a player meets the requirement to click an item successfully.
# You can simply use placeholders, or the keywords provided to give you access to the Player and Server objects.
# If you want to check if a player has enough money, simply use an expression like so:
# 
# expression: '%vaulteco_balance% >= 100' (checks if players balance is greater than or equal to 100)
# If you want to charge the player, simply run the economy command to take the amount from the players balance in your click_commands
# which will be executed if the player meets the requirement!
# ==============================================================
# 
# View requirement information
# 
# You can add a 'view requirement' to an item if it has a priority value set for it
# The view requirement has replaced the 'permission' entry for items
# This allows you to specify a specific requirement in javascript for the item to be shown
# In order to use view requirements, the item must have a priority value and a valid javascript expression
# that returns true or false. 
# 
#   'item_one':
#     material: DIAMOND
#     slot: 3
#     priority: 1
#     view_requirement: '%vaulteco_balance% > 100'
#   'item_two':
#     material: IRON_INGOT
#     slot: 3
#     priority: 2
#     view_requirement: 'BukkitPlayer.hasPermission("some.permission")'
#   'item_three':
#     material: STONE
#     slot: 3
#     priority: 3
# 
# In the example above, the priority 1 item view requirement will be checked first, if a player has over 100 dollars, that item will be shown.
# If the player does not meet the requirement for the first item, the item with priority 2 will be checked. If the player does not have the permission
# node some.permission, the final item 'item_three' will be set to slot 3 as the player did not meet the requirement for the first 2 items with
# a higher priority.
# 
# You may use placeholders in your Javascript expressions to evaluate if the player meets the requirement or not.
# You may also use a few keywords which give you access to the Player class and Bukkit.Server class if you understand the Bukkit API
# 
# BukkitPlayer - references the Player object your expression is evaluating.
# BukkitServer - references Bukkit.getServer() in the Bukkit API.
# 
# The choice to use this system to evaluate if a player meets requirements to click an item was an easy choice.
# This way I do not have to hook into every plugin to check if a player meets the requirement to click an item successfully.
# You can simply use placeholders, or the keywords provided to give you access to the Player and Server objects.
# If you want to check if a player has enough money, simply use an expression like so:
# 
# view_requirement: '%vault_eco_balance% >= 100' (checks if players balance is greater than or equal to 100)
# ==============================================================
# 
# 
# You do not need to specify item options that you don't use!
# The only required entries for a gui menu item to be valid are:
# 
# A valid material
# A valid slot
# 
# Every item in the items list must have a unique <item identifier>
# 
# If you choose to update placeholders for a specific item, you must specify update_interval: <time>
# in the GUI menu options for the specific GUI menu.
# Only GUI menus with at least one item that has update: true will update those specific items placeholders.
# 
# Every click_command must start with a specific identifier to know what to do for the execution.
# Valid click_command identifiers:
# 
# [console] - Execute a command from the console
# Usage: - '[console] <command with no slash>'
# 
# [player] - Execute a command for the menu viewer
# Usage: - '[player] <command with no slash>'
# 
# [commandevent] - Fire a PlayerCommandPreprocessEvent for commands that do not use the bukkit command system
# Usage: - '[commandevent] <command with no slash>'
# 
# [message] - Send a message to the menu viewer
# Usage: - [message] <message to send to the player
# 
# [openguimenu] - Open a GUI menu (can only be used in GUI menu click_commands)
# Usage: - '[openguimenu] <guiMenuName>'
# 
# [connect] - Connect to the specified bungee server
# Usage: - '[connect] <serverName>'
# 
# [close] - Close the viewers open menu
# Usage: - '[close]
# 
# [refresh] - Refresh items in the current menu view
# Usage: - '[refresh]
# 
# [json] - Send a json message to the menu viewer
# Usage: - '[json] {"text":"message"}'
# 
# 
# 
# You can delay any of the click command being performed by ending the command with
# <delay=(time in TICKS)>
# example:
#     - '[close]'
#     - '[message] it has been 5 seconds since the menu closed!<delay=100>'
#     - '[message] it has been 10 seconds since the menu closed!<delay=200>'
# 
# A delay should NOT be added to the [close] or [openguimenu] actions
# as it could potentially cause unknown issues or glitches with menus.
